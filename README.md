# Flight-Delays
This project aims to predict the delays that can occur between a flight taking off from an airport and landing at a particular airport. Various delays such as departure delay, arrival delay, taxi delay and more have been accounted for and the overall model predicts the combined delay that can occur.

# Prerequisites
The dataset that I have used was obtained from Kaggle and this is the link:

# Running the test
To run the entire notebook, got to "cell" in the toolbar and choose "run all". The execution will halt when it encounters line with errors.
I have kept the errors to showcase what can go wrong and how to fix them. Juat delete the cell containing error and click "run all below" to run the commands after the last executed cell.
